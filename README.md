TODO:Describe the app

## Installation

Check this repository out and then execute:

    $ bundle && bundle exec rake install

Or install it yourself as (currently not available):

    $ gem install locator

## Usage

Just run `locator` to start the webserver.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To run the locator for debugging while developing just run `/bin/locator`.

The Sinatra App itself is located inside the `lib` directory together with all the default directories like `views` or `lib`.
